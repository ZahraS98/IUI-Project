In my opinion this is a 6.5/10 (An extra 2 rating because it is free.)Reasons Why?Pros:They have quite a lot of guns inside of the game,The gameplay is decent but the fps does not stay stable,A good game if you're looking just to chill and play some games on the night or something,Graphics are quite good for a free game,Best of all it's free!Cons:FPS isn't stable a lot of the time,All guns have hardly any recoil some don't even have recoil at all,You could have full health and the enemy could have 5/100 and still be able to kill you,Animations and Modelling could be slightly better,Might get repetitive over time,Takes quite long to unlock the AWP and M60 in a game (Snipers)You can shoot someone anywhere with a sniper and kill them in 1, you can even kill them in 1 shot to their foot,When you run into your team mates or enemies you just end up walking over them.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Early Access Review  Title WARMODE   Developer WARTEAM   Publisher WARTEAM  Release 25 August 2015  Graphics 3D   Genre FPS  Price Free-to-play  Rating 5/10 The game.WARMODE is a FPS about the confrontation of two sides, represented by the government military and the armed hirelings.Gameplay.An interesting game, still in early-alpha. Can be more than this or just stagnant here. Personally, I don't believe that can be more than this. There are some aspects that make the game be banal, like as weapon balance, some (or maybe the majority) weapons don't have no recoil, and the damage taken or induced is very weird. Btw, I played in a map much imitated of the Dust 2 of the Counter-Strike. I don't know the name but the map have very similar details. I don't like imitations.One more thing, if you have any first-person-shooter game experience, you'll literally be the best player on here and there is a great possibility of being called a hacker. One ranked as gold in CS GO can be a global here in just 20 minutes (lol). I got that feeling. Or in WARMODE just have low skill players.The game isn't bad but there are really betters on Steam. Some aspects like lag need to be fixed, servers are unstable. And please, don't compare CS GO to WARMODE, it only reveals ignorance. Counter-Strike has many years, already suffered so many changes and for sure is better, incomparable, WARMODE is an early-alpha game. The game is free, soft and with a simple interface, you need to consider these aspects too before give a negative review just because yes. I'll give a chance and I'll come back later.Positive points. (+)Free-to-play.Simple and fun interface.The devs read the reviews.Negative points. (-)Majority of the weapons don't have no recoil.The damage taken or induced is very weird.Could have more mods and maps.Need to fix some servers with lag.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Early Access ReviewI like the old style simple graphics that will run on any machine.I like the simple gameplay and common game mechanics.I like the fact it's a free game and for an alpha actually it's quite playable.I wish in the future it gets some common/classic objective gametypes.Maps are currently too small. They should be at least 2 or 3 times larger.Definitely following the development of this game and hopefully they bring us something cool to play on a daily base.</td>\n",

In my opinion this is a 6.5/10 (An extra 2 rating because it is free.)Reasons Why?Pros:They have quite a lot of guns inside of the game,The gameplay is decent but the fps does not stay stable,A good game if you're looking just to chill and play some games on the night or something,Graphics are quite good for a free game,Best of all it's free!Cons:FPS isn't stable a lot of the time,All guns have hardly any recoil some don't even have recoil at all,You could have full health and the enemy could have 5/100 and still be able to kill you,Animations and Modelling could be slightly better,Might get repetitive over time,Takes quite long to unlock the AWP and M60 in a game (Snipers)You can shoot someone anywhere with a sniper and kill them in 1, you can even kill them in 1 shot to their foot,When you run into your team mates or enemies you just end up walking over them.   \n",

This is one of my first games and I loved it, and it's very good for ppl that love FPS. <3   \n",

They should be at least 2 or 3 times larger.Definitely following the development of this game and hopefully they bring us something cool to play on a daily base.   \n",

A man in a top hat approached me and asked me if I wanted a balloon. Me being the child I was accepted that balloon as fast as humanly possible, the balloon was a black and white balloon just in case you are wondering. Well when me and my family were leaving the carnival I wanted some cotton candy, and my parents being as loving as they were (And me being the spoiled♥♥♥♥♥♥I was) bought me the cotton candy, but as we were going to the car♥♥♥♥♥♥took a turn for the worst. My hands were getting sweaty since it was not only 90 plus degrees outside but also I've been holding the string of this balloon all day. Well I wasn't paying attention and the side walk was like \"Nah nah nah. This boy has a balloon on my turf? Nah he about to lose that balloon.\" And just like that the sidewalk rose as I took another step, not only get my face covered in the sticky mess we call cotton candy, but also causing me to drop my balloon. And I balled like the little ♥♥♥♥♥ 8 year old I was thinking my life was over cause of a balloon. Moral of the story: Don't accept a strange mans balloon.</td>\n",

Basically, rather than a hoard of bloons that are set by the computer, You play against others, attacking with your own bloons while trying to defend. For anyone that's played Clash Royale, it's sooorta like that (Except this came first). I'll also bring up how in singleplayer bloons games, you have access to every tower you've unlocked. But in battles, the battle lasts an hour at most, so you can only use 3 of your unlocked towers, and one more random tower. This can bring up some interesting combinations, letting you experiment on which one works best.       Many of you may know that there's a mobile version for this game. While you probably can't take this version around with you, depending on what kind of computer you have, This versions framerate is much better than the mobile version. And due to the use of a mouse and higher definition graphics, you can place towers in more precise locations.       In the end I don't really have many problems with this game. It's a solid, multiplayer tower defense. However, certain functions are blocked by a paywall, so look out for that.</td>\n",

       "16527                                             My hatred for balloons started when I was only 9 years old. I went to a carnival with my family. I remember this day more vivid than any other. A man in a top hat approached me and asked me if I wanted a balloon. Me being the child I was accepted that balloon as fast as humanly possible, the balloon was a black and white balloon just in case you are wondering. Well when me and my family were leaving the carnival I wanted some cotton candy, and my parents being as loving as they were (And me being the spoiled♥♥♥♥♥♥I was) bought me the cotton candy, but as we were going to the car♥♥♥♥♥♥took a turn for the worst. My hands were getting sweaty since it was not only 90 plus degrees outside but also I've been holding the string of this balloon all day. Well I wasn't paying attention and the side walk was like \"Nah nah nah. This boy has a balloon on my turf? Nah he about to lose that balloon.\" And just like that the sidewalk rose as I took another step, not only get my face covered in the sticky mess we call cotton candy, but also causing me to drop my balloon. And I balled like the little ♥♥♥♥♥ 8 year old I was thinking my life was over cause of a balloon. Moral of the story: Don't accept a strange mans balloon.   \n",
       "16528  Y'know I've always enjoyed bloons since the first game. While this doesn't exactly play like the previous instalments in the series, it's absolutely a welcome change to me. Basically, rather than a hoard of bloons that are set by the computer, You play against others, attacking with your own bloons while trying to defend. For anyone that's played Clash Royale, it's sooorta like that (Except this came first). I'll also bring up how in singleplayer bloons games, you have access to every tower you've unlocked. But in battles, the battle lasts an hour at most, so you can only use 3 of your unlocked towers, and one more random tower. This can bring up some interesting combinations, letting you experiment on which one works best.       Many of you may know that there's a mobile version for this game. While you probably can't take this version around with you, depending on what kind of computer you have, This versions framerate is much better than the mobile version. And due to the use of a mouse and higher definition graphics, you can place towers in more precise locations.       In the end I don't really have many problems with this game. It's a solid, multiplayer tower defense. However, certain functions are blocked by a paywall, so look out for that.   \n",

You will be able to learn every aspect of racism and realize what actually \"e♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; means within DotA 2 i.e Anyone below 3000 MMR is trash tier with a 2 inch♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and their opinion is always invalid. DotA 2 is also a pathway for you to be fluent in many different languages such as Chineese, Korean, Thai, Malay, Russian and many others. The secret to climbing MMR is insta-locking the most broken hero in every game. Currently I just spam KoTL for ez mmr. Overall 10/10 game, very addictive, highly recommended.   \n",

Also fufills the second language requirement for numerous eastern european universities. 420/10 would play again.   \n",

Undoubtedly, DOTA2 is a diversified game, you won't guess what happen in next time! And DOTA2 makes player needs some individual skills, so we can free choice of heroes, not boring EU tactic. In the end, if you are loving DOTA(or MOBA) game, don't missed DOTA2!!!    \n",

By playing this glorious game you will also learn how to speak several languages as for some reason Russians and Peruvians like to join the US East and West servers when they have servers in their own country. Im sure you are already sold by this point, but just to add on one more thing about this game is that you will also learn how seriously people take this game and realize truly how terrible you are at this game because you have less than 3,000 hours played.   \n",
