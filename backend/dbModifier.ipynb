You used to be able to get classes without paying in; this was quickly thrown behind a paywall if you didn't have them already.You used to be able to get some gear in the shop without spending cash, cubits or something like that were the currency, obtained through dailies. This was consumer friendly, and still allowed them to make some cash for the people impatient or wanting something now, but was quickly removed. No rewards were given for extra cubits, or whatever they were called (haven't launched the game in so long).Servers were garbage, but it was acceptable because you didn't pay in. Now, to have access to most of the critical/essential/advertised features, you have to pay in. I'd highly suggest that they move to a demo and paid model rather than a freemium.TL;DRI quit trove because it went pay to win. Explanation above, and critical sentence(s) below.That's my two cents though. If you hate on me, please read the first sentence and actually think about what you're doing/accomplishing.

       "7705   It's honestly kind of funny to see how aggressive people get in the comments, even though everyone is equally entitled to their own opinion (and their own opinion is only right for themselves, regardless of stance, my own included).I quit trove after playing for a pretty long time (413.4 hours as of this review) because of the updates moving toward the paid side. You used to be able to get classes without paying in; this was quickly thrown behind a paywall if you didn't have them already.You used to be able to get some gear in the shop without spending cash, cubits or something like that were the currency, obtained through dailies. This was consumer friendly, and still allowed them to make some cash for the people impatient or wanting something now, but was quickly removed. No rewards were given for extra cubits, or whatever they were called (haven't launched the game in so long).Servers were garbage, but it was acceptable because you didn't pay in. Now, to have access to most of the critical/essential/advertised features, you have to pay in. I'd highly suggest that they move to a demo and paid model rather than a freemium.TL;DRI quit trove because it went pay to win. Explanation above, and critical sentence(s) below.That's my two cents though. If you hate on me, please read the first sentence and actually think about what you're doing/accomplishing. If you disagree, by all means, you're entitled to your own thoughts.   \n",

This game is adorable and creepy like my happy tree friends but with the graphics sceme of my childhood (but more bubble and 'clean').  Hello 1990's.What charactes there are (that isnot trying to kill me) were likable and a bit odd.  I did do a few noob things though, such as:Oh look a class room full of ghosts from dead children, lets shine my flashlight on them and stand there staring at them..Or, hmm creepy music, I'll turn around and see if I can see what's chasing me.Never before in a game have I been this afraid of finding a locked door.   \n",

I called him overweight and stupid, but I went along with it. Later that night after making sweet love to my left small toe, he called me to play Business Tour. I agreed, and went along with it. I launched the shortcut that I had created in my Other Games folder (I have another called lit games), since I assumed it would be lame. Oh how I was wrong.As I started my first game, the sweet sky background rushed into my irises like a wave into the shore, clensing and slightly aroding it because I forgot to have my blue light filter on at 11:30 at night. Off topic. I found my character...She spoke to me. Her lucious lox and curvy bosum. I was a kid again, seeing my crush for the first time. As I rolled my first pair of dice, I went straight to Lost Island. I proceeded to smack my keyboard against the wall and broke it. Along with that, the plastic shards bounced into the tempered glass sidepanel of my PC, shattering it onto my recently moisturized hands. Glass punctured my skin as I let out a scream of pure terror. I then passed out and woke up in the emergency room two hours later.My friend stood over my and said I sucked at Business Tour - Online Multiplayer Board Game, and left. I cried that day, and I remember it like it was yesterday. I will always remeber how I felt as that excited feeling fell to terror and my world fell apart.Rating:8/10 would play again.- Nice bobs</td>\n",

       "15347  How can I start this...I guess from the beginning. A friend told me one day to download a game, it was called Business Tour - Online Multiplayer Board Game. I called him overweight and stupid, but I went along with it. Later that night after making sweet love to my left small toe, he called me to play Business Tour. I agreed, and went along with it. I launched the shortcut that I had created in my Other Games folder (I have another called lit games), since I assumed it would be lame. Oh how I was wrong.As I started my first game, the sweet sky background rushed into my irises like a wave into the shore, clensing and slightly aroding it because I forgot to have my blue light filter on at 11:30 at night. Off topic. I found my character...She spoke to me. Her lucious lox and curvy bosum. I was a kid again, seeing my crush for the first time. As I rolled my first pair of dice, I went straight to Lost Island. I proceeded to smack my keyboard against the wall and broke it. Along with that, the plastic shards bounced into the tempered glass sidepanel of my PC, shattering it onto my recently moisturized hands. Glass punctured my skin as I let out a scream of pure terror. I then passed out and woke up in the emergency room two hours later.My friend stood over my and said I sucked at Business Tour - Online Multiplayer Board Game, and left. I cried that day, and I remember it like it was yesterday. I will always remeber how I felt as that excited feeling fell to terror and my world fell apart.Rating:8/10 would play again.- Nice bobs   \n",
