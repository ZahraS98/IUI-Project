       "      <td>Dota 2 is a 5-v-5 MOBA game. You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available.The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams’ Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. You’ll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, you’ll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team.Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that you’ll be teamed up with won’t always show the same willingness to communicate. If you’re just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique.Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if you’re playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldn’t prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, don’t worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game.</td>\n",

       "1836   Dota 2 is a 5-v-5 MOBA game. You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available.The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams’ Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. You’ll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, you’ll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team.Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that you’ll be teamed up with won’t always show the same willingness to communicate. If you’re just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique.Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if you’re playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldn’t prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, don’t worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game.   \n",

There are a few problems however. A: The community is toxic af. This game is full of rude people, thieves and griefers.B: When you die, you drop all your items, and someone probably steals them.C: This game seems a lot like a cash-grab   \n",
