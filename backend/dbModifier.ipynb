But besides that this game is fairly face-paced and action oriented. Therefore there are barely any times where you aren't shooting your handy dandy killing thingy. Not only that but the graphics aren't so shabby, did I mention that this game runs on an old Dell laptop that has an Intel Core i3 on it? OH! I ALMOST FORGOT TO MENTION!

You had to put time into the game to get anywhere, and even then you could lose it all in one death. Regardless of that, it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put 5+ hours a week. Personally, I was very addicted to this game during 2011 and 2012. Then, doomsday came: Kabam bought Realm of The Mad God. Everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things. Back in the old days, you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier 12 item in the wine cellar. Now, just buy realm gold and get tier 12 items in nexus.

It's almost as if Call of Duty and Counter-Strike had a baby. But besides that this game is fairly face-paced and action oriented. Therefore there are barely any times where you aren't shooting your handy dandy killing thingy. Not only that but the graphics aren't so shabby, did I mention that this game runs on an old Dell laptop that has an Intel Core i3 on it? OH! I ALMOST FORGOT TO MENTION! THIS GAME HAS A  BETTER  ANTI-CHEAT THAN THE NOTORIOUS COMPANY  VALVE ! WHICH IS A WIN WIN! AND DESERVES A  100  OUT OF 10!   \n",
       "7968   Allow me to start this review by saying that the game in it's basic,free to play version is a decent one to say the least,with a pretty nice community and enjoyable gameplay.Why then am I not recommening this game?It is common knowledge that these types of games are leaning more and more towards P2W,but while other games might actually care about you if you spend money,not this one.Not if use your Steam Wallet to buy the products at any rate.I used my Steam Wallet to buy some currency called Zen,hoping to sell it in game for quick Astral Diamonds,which is basically the common currency.Not only was I not rewarded the First Time buyer's pack,which is reserved for people who buy directly from Arc,my account was put on Probation: meaning anything I buy is bound to my account and I am unable to sell Zen.You would think a day or two while they verify the payment would be understandable,but it has been a week and a half and I am still on probation.I thought fine,lets try something else,so I bought Enchanted Keys which let you open Lockboxes,hoping to find a decent item to sell in the Auction House.The keys were also bound but what they fail to mention is EVEN THE REWARDS IN THE LOCKBOXES WILL BE BOUND.So for example if you found a mount selling for around 6million Astral Diamonds which you do not like or already have you're stuck with it.I can almost hear people say \"Dum*a// of course the rewards will be bound,your key was also bound\" but you are wrong,VIP players (and yes I am one) get an Enchanted Key everyday which is also bound,however the rewards opened with it are not.So to recap,I do recommend this game in the Free to Play mode,possibly get VIP,but do not bother using more money to be treated like a third grade citizen.   \n",

Edge Case have shown a willingness to listen to the community that players could only dream of from other early access developers. Thanks for making this less of a sluggish grindfest and more of a MOBA, Edge Case!   \n",

This game used to be amazing, fun, interactive and enjoyable. You had to put time into the game to get anywhere, and even then you could lose it all in one death. Regardless of that, it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put 5+ hours a week. Personally, I was very addicted to this game during 2011 and 2012. Then, doomsday came: Kabam bought Realm of The Mad God. Everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things. Back in the old days, you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier 12 item in the wine cellar. Now, just buy realm gold and get tier 12 items in nexus. It's ♥♥♥♥ed up.Unless you're rich as ♥♥♥♥ and don't care about money, don't get this game.   \n",

This game is adorable and creepy like my happy tree friends but with the graphics sceme of my childhood (but more bubble and 'clean').  Hello 1990's.What charactes there are (that isnot trying to kill me) were likable and a bit odd.  I did do a few noob things though, such as:Oh look a class room full of ghosts from dead children, lets shine my flashlight on them and stand there staring at them..Or, hmm creepy music, I'll turn around and see if I can see what's chasing me.Never before in a game have I been this afraid of finding a locked door.</td>\n",

This game is adorable and creepy like my happy tree friends but with the graphics sceme of my childhood (but more bubble and 'clean').  Hello 1990's.What charactes there are (that isnot trying to kill me) were likable and a bit odd.  I did do a few noob things though, such as:Oh look a class room full of ghosts from dead children, lets shine my flashlight on them and stand there staring at them..Or, hmm creepy music, I'll turn around and see if I can see what's chasing me.Never before in a game have I been this afraid of finding a locked door.   \n",

       "      <td>Early Access ReviewTLDR: Started ranting or covering unimportant things. Game has a few balance issues but is fun as mess otherwise. Plus it's only been out 3 days soHonestly suprised I liked this game. I tried Fortnite out day 1 of its \"release\" and moved on after 2 or so games. It just wasn't that fun to me. Thought this game would be similar but, oh boy was I wrong. This game has something.It's smooth almost all the time when it comes to frames and whatnot. It'll dip every now and then but that's about it. I got in an infinite fall once...and my movement abililty, that is on every class, got me out of it. That's solid foresight. A few times I've been in gun fights with people who seemed to be able to move extremely fast and stay locked on, but that might be some Fortnight kids migrating. I'm just assuming there's no real hackers here yet. Of course, there are laggers though. I think there's no Oceania servers or something, but I didn't really care enough to look into it. Assuming it was just some people on my server who shouldn't be there.The abilities are really cool. I thought it'd be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanic just tacked on, but it really adds to the fighting and chasing down people. There should probably be a way to read what levels do what and which abilities do what before having to go in game and test it out. Every class's movement ability is interesting and have their own purpose, but I wouldn't say they're all good or even viable honestly. Shocker that jumping directly into the air at a 90 degree angle is not great in combat. Obviously, a few abilities need to be buffed to keep up with the others but I truly think nothing needs to be nerfed except maybe max armor, doubling your life is kind of crazy (1200 ARM - 1200 Health)I could go on a little longer but I feel like I'm trying to convince a friend to get this game rather than leaving a review to help people.

       "8568   Early Access ReviewTLDR: Started ranting or covering unimportant things. Game has a few balance issues but is fun as mess otherwise. Plus it's only been out 3 days soHonestly suprised I liked this game. I tried Fortnite out day 1 of its \"release\" and moved on after 2 or so games. It just wasn't that fun to me. Thought this game would be similar but, oh boy was I wrong. This game has something.It's smooth almost all the time when it comes to frames and whatnot. It'll dip every now and then but that's about it. I got in an infinite fall once...and my movement abililty, that is on every class, got me out of it. That's solid foresight. A few times I've been in gun fights with people who seemed to be able to move extremely fast and stay locked on, but that might be some Fortnight kids migrating. I'm just assuming there's no real hackers here yet. Of course, there are laggers though. I think there's no Oceania servers or something, but I didn't really care enough to look into it. Assuming it was just some people on my server who shouldn't be there.The abilities are really cool. I thought it'd be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanic just tacked on, but it really adds to the fighting and chasing down people. There should probably be a way to read what levels do what and which abilities do what before having to go in game and test it out. Every class's movement ability is interesting and have their own purpose, but I wouldn't say they're all good or even viable honestly. Shocker that jumping directly into the air at a 90 degree angle is not great in combat. Obviously, a few abilities need to be buffed to keep up with the others but I truly think nothing needs to be nerfed except maybe max armor, doubling your life is kind of crazy (1200 ARM - 1200 Health)I could go on a little longer but I feel like I'm trying to convince a friend to get this game rather than leaving a review to help people. Sorry about that.   \n",
