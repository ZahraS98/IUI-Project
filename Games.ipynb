Massive 2,000 player servers, spread across 3 different continents and across 3 warring factions, oh glory be.Being a F2P game (free to play), you don't have a reason to at least not try the game out. That is if your computer can handle it. Previously, the game was extremely poorly optimized for AMD CPU's, and t hat has recently changed. Where i was once getting 12 frames in large Biodome fights, I'm now giving it 45 bonus points.Now, the game is an infantry-vehicular combat game. The 3 factions fight over different facilities across each continent that provide different passive boosts to weapon and item costs and resource gains. Every time you purchase a grenade for your soldier, you use infantry resources, same goes with C4, personal med-kits and the highly useful and badass MAX suits. Vehicles take the apropriate resources as well and depending upon what you attach to it, cost more.Now, the three factions are all similar yet very different, both aesthetically and performance wise. the New Conglomerate have slower firing more powerful older type weapons while the Vannu Sovereignty have laser weapons with perfect accuracy, no bullet drop but dow low damage. Each faction has a shared few vehicles and their own fighter plane, heavy tank and different weapons for each shared vehicle as well.Now, Planetside 2 is a free-to-play title, but don't let that scare you away. Most games have a pay-to-win model to be more precise, whre as long as you just dump money into the game, you will have much improved gear over others, and this is why most F2P games fail, but not PS2. The only thing real money is good for in PS2 is purchasing a subscription which gives you an allowence of 500 SC (station cash) per month and an XP and Cert bonus. Certs are what is used to unlock weapons and attachments while SC is used to purchase weapons skipping the arning of certs as well as customization options such as camos, helmets, and emblems on your soldier and vehicles.YOu can not buy certs outright, which is where the balancing is. Each weapoin can be moddified heavily with weapoin attatchments which alter their performance drastically from 1x red dot sights to 20x sniper rifle scopes or silencers or weapon grips. It all depends. These are purchased using certs. You earn 1 cert per 1000 xp in game. While the weapon may be bought with SC and skip the 1000 cert price point, the attachments must be earned through play.I know this review is all over the place, but if you like FPS's on a massive scale, skip that Battlefield 4 64 player nonsense and jump right inot an amazing free game, Planetside 2.</td>\n",

Granted you may be reading a book for about a month until you're at a minimum proficiency with the aircraft but the payoff is worth it. The sense of achievement that you get when you learn any of these aircraft is amazing as it's not just a case of pumping the throttle to maximum to take off like other plane games. The future is very bright for this simulator as it is ever growing with more developers creating different aircraft for different theatres of war i.e. WWII / Korea / 80's/ Modern.</td>\n",

       "8942   Oh, Planetside 2. How glorious you are. Massive 2,000 player servers, spread across 3 different continents and across 3 warring factions, oh glory be.Being a F2P game (free to play), you don't have a reason to at least not try the game out. That is if your computer can handle it. Previously, the game was extremely poorly optimized for AMD CPU's, and t hat has recently changed. Where i was once getting 12 frames in large Biodome fights, I'm now giving it 45 bonus points.Now, the game is an infantry-vehicular combat game. The 3 factions fight over different facilities across each continent that provide different passive boosts to weapon and item costs and resource gains. Every time you purchase a grenade for your soldier, you use infantry resources, same goes with C4, personal med-kits and the highly useful and badass MAX suits. Vehicles take the apropriate resources as well and depending upon what you attach to it, cost more.Now, the three factions are all similar yet very different, both aesthetically and performance wise. the New Conglomerate have slower firing more powerful older type weapons while the Vannu Sovereignty have laser weapons with perfect accuracy, no bullet drop but dow low damage. Each faction has a shared few vehicles and their own fighter plane, heavy tank and different weapons for each shared vehicle as well.Now, Planetside 2 is a free-to-play title, but don't let that scare you away. Most games have a pay-to-win model to be more precise, whre as long as you just dump money into the game, you will have much improved gear over others, and this is why most F2P games fail, but not PS2. The only thing real money is good for in PS2 is purchasing a subscription which gives you an allowence of 500 SC (station cash) per month and an XP and Cert bonus. Certs are what is used to unlock weapons and attachments while SC is used to purchase weapons skipping the arning of certs as well as customization options such as camos, helmets, and emblems on your soldier and vehicles.YOu can not buy certs outright, which is where the balancing is. Each weapoin can be moddified heavily with weapoin attatchments which alter their performance drastically from 1x red dot sights to 20x sniper rifle scopes or silencers or weapon grips. It all depends. These are purchased using certs. You earn 1 cert per 1000 xp in game. While the weapon may be bought with SC and skip the 1000 cert price point, the attachments must be earned through play.I know this review is all over the place, but if you like FPS's on a massive scale, skip that Battlefield 4 64 player nonsense and jump right inot an amazing free game, Planetside 2.    \n",

Similar to magic the gathering in a lot of ways but much more accessible and usable online. Tutorial isn't great but once you're over that hump it's fast to get into the game and build some cool decks.   \n",

This game is garbage, i said it a million times, and i wont hesitate to say it again. It sucks. The dungeons and first games are great, giving you a purpose of how good the game feels, then you meet the community, and PVP system. Once again. This game sucks♥♥♥♥♥ If you rage easily, do not play this game. That is all.   \n",

After 200h spend in game hoping for something good my expectation were totaly ruined by last patch and poor commucation by NEOWIZ, these guys have no idea what they are doing and what the game needs. Instead of fixing stuff they are ruining more and more. I can't stand this anymore. The game is GARBAGE, the company is GARGBAGE. I am out of here. I can't bealiave i actually paid money for this unfinished product and before someone tell you its Early Access, trust me the current condition will stays the same even after years. The game population went from 50k to 5k players in a week. I don't suggest the game to anyone, better spend your 30 USD/EURO for tetris, its much more fun.     \n",

I invested $20 once, wound up with a fast mount, heirloom weapons, and bunch of cash shop currency (to buy bags etc). Also did premium for a month, that gives you a loot crate key and some silver bars (a special currency) daily, which is pretty good.-It's free to play (you won't feel the cash shop draw for at least 20-30 hours).All in all, if you're eyeballing it, give it a shot. Once you get to the point where the cash shop starts feeling necessary, either invest or don't EZPZ.   \n",

The ingame economy is broken, prevents youform playing if close to top tier vehicles without pumping in boatloads of realworld currency, and in addition to this, instead of atttempting to alleviate the gameplay or in game economy issues, the developers simply continue to nerf rewards, and add higher and higher tier vehicles which aren't even feasible to obtain or maintain in game.   \n",

It's considered camping if you use a TD for it's actual purpose. And half the time when some event comes along, people just buy the tanks and don't work for them. And the people that work for them, get cut off when the event ends. To top it off, some people act like they control the entire team, so when they die, it's everyone else's fault (Give or Take). It's better just playing World Of Tanks instead of this. It's fun, but sometimes it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   \n",

It's a free game and it's unique, you won't find similar experience, it is intense, it is heavy combat, it shreds your pc in half because of so much happening at the same time and has people using their mics with battlecry and warsongs.You will die A LOT, it's the Dark Souls of MMO, you will die but yet, you will feel happy because of so much fighting.Take your time to enjoy the game, don't try to rush things and get bored quickly.Don't base your opinion on the game on others, play it, and you will discover for sure that there is still great potential in a 6 year old game.It's the only game that can hook me up for an entire day of battle.Also, findind a good outfit is A MUST HAVE for 100% enjoyement inside the game, and also to have someone to teach you things.Planetside2 has a lot of problems, but those problems don't take the light out of the game.Go out there and fight for Auraxis!Ricardo23*   \n",

I've played plenty of other F2P games that really drew me in, and made me want to spend my money.  This game is not like that.Example:The bazooka unlocks at a fairly low level, there are tanks everywhere, and no-one shoots them. Why?  Each bazooka round costs 1/6 of the credits (in game currency) I typically make in a match, and it takes 3 hits to kill most tanks.  This means, If I try to help out my team and destroy that tank that's been shelling us for 5 minutes, assuming perfect aim, it's going to cost me half of what I make that match.   \n",

I confess that I own nearly all of the modules. I play DCS primarily for the SINGLE player experience, not the multiplayer one. This is due to the netcode that DCS has - it's rather garbage for multiplayer. However, multiplayer issue aside, DCS is one of the best aviation simulations to date. Yes, the modules (prop planes jet planes, helicopters, several maps, and one *mostly* unpolished/unloved land vehicle module) are expensive - but they are nearly always stunning in their level of detail, and the quality of the experience almost always leaves this particular aviation enthusiast in a sense of awe. I recommend this game to any aviation enthusiast who has the following: A lot of patience and time to research the module they want to learn, a powerful computer, and a HOTAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick) setup. Having TrackIR/TrackHat greatly improves the experience.   \n",

I don't even need to list the reasons why it's so bad.To name one off the top of my head, the spawns are pre set, and when you spawn you'll likely meet your death to somebody camping on a hill nearby your spawn location.   \n",

Till the 7.00.Now i want to install WC3 and play dota1 again. I guess that is my only chance to get the \"dota feeling\" again. It is not dota since 7.00. They should change it's name.RIP DOTA   \n",

DCS offers a chance to step into a legendry aircraft with unparalleled precision and accuracy true to its original design. Granted you may be reading a book for about a month until you're at a minimum proficiency with the aircraft but the payoff is worth it. The sense of achievement that you get when you learn any of these aircraft is amazing as it's not just a case of pumping the throttle to maximum to take off like other plane games. The future is very bright for this simulator as it is ever growing with more developers creating different aircraft for different theatres of war i.e. WWII / Korea / 80's/ Modern.   \n",
