Hello 1990's.What charactes there are (that isnot trying to kill me) were likable and a bit odd.  I did do a few noob things though, such as:Oh look a class room full of ghosts from dead children, lets shine my flashlight on them and stand there staring at them..Or, hmm creepy music, I'll turn around and see if I can see what's chasing me.Never before in a game have I been this afraid of finding a locked door.   \n",

But these past couple years the game has been deteriorating rapidly, Gaijin has been neglecting what the community wants and needs. They have been implementing more and more premium vehicles into the game (which I am not necessarily against) but by doing so they have been letting new players get to the higher tiers, they have gone against their old saying of not letting people buy in to tier 5 instead of earning it. Worst of all, Gaijin has recently mocked their own community with the FPE &amp; Parts debacle. Gaijin has consistently failed to mend damage with the community, and instead are seeking profits rather than a healthy game. While I do understand that the whole business is to make money, it is sad to see a game that the company once seemed they loved and had passion for is now another money making sham. If you want to play this game, go ahead, I imagine you will enjoy tier 1 and 2 but it is not worth putting your money in to, it is not worth putting a lot of energy and love in to.</td>\n",

But with the 23/9/15 patch they brought the IS3 back so it could face Panthers and Pershings, as well as bringing back every single top tier tank down the same way.1960s Cold War vehicles are now matched against Tiger 2s, IS2s and M26s. Tanks like the Maus and T-10M are absolutely destroying entire teams-worth of players BY THEMSELVES. This whole review hasn't even touched on the mess that is endgame plane content either, with Tempest prop planes getting eaten alive by MiG15s and 1944-era Me262s fighting the cream of the crop from the Korean War the F86 Sabre and MiG15bis.These changes do have an effect on the low tiers but they are less noticeable than the devastating, game-breaking blow that has been dealt to mid-high tier gameplay. I was excited, I was happy, I almost had my M47 Patton.

       "      <td>Early Access ReviewIf you're looking for a good free Battle Royale game, this is worth a try. It's still very early and is still missing a lot, but what is already available is definitely worth playing. While I wasn't a fan of my first game due to lack of real explanation of what anything is, a few more games in and I'm starting to get the hang of things. Setting this in a more MMO/WoW setting is a nice change, but the biggest difference between this and every other similar game I've played is the classes and abilities. While you do still spend your time figuring out where to drop and looking for loot, you can take the loot you don't like, discard it for shards, and use those shards to craft items at forges located around the map. Everyone having a mount can speed up movement quite a bit, but doesn't make the map feel any smaller when you do it. The downsides right now to me are when you are near a fight, everything is fine, but if you aren't, you can sometimes see gunshots and explosions in the distance but don't hear any sound at all. I also haven't heard any footsteps from other players unless they were on a mount, which cuts down on situational awareness. The lack of proper descriptions on things, especially abilities, can make things really confusing, but it's not too hard to figure out. I'm also waiting for more personality to be added. Running around as a chicken after you've been downed is cute and different, but lack of customization on characters, armor not really showing on people when you see them, and no emotes makes it feel a bit soulless, but I'm positive that stuff will be added in later.Definitely worth a try and I'm looking forward to seeing how it does. It's nice to have a more fantasy themed BR where I don't have to worry about building. Fortnite and PUBG are fine, but this kind of fills the hole that Radical Heights left in my heart.</td>\n",

This game offers so much, but it's rather difficult to get into, while being incredibly easy to get in to. Starting the game and exploring is fun and you can do it from day one, at first glance it's a fun game, but nothing you'd spent much time on. Now If you look past that, there is actually so much. The leveling system isn't what determines a character. Maxed stats are. In game \"potions\" are used as a sort of currency in the trading economy, along with gear and other items. These potions are obtained by defeating difficult enemies and completeing certain dungeons.  To problem is, getting this far takes practice, detrmination and grit. Death is inevitable, dont let it set you back. Learning how to rebound from deaths becomes an integral feature as you make characters that are more and more powerful. Even the most powerful characters who have all 8 stats maxed are prone to quick deaths, the game in unforgiving, and requires skill, but offers much in return for those who deliver.</td>\n",

This game brings me back to when Lego Universe existed, and it has a very similar feeling to it. Lots of classes, fair play, some minor tweaking needed here and there, but overall, great game.   \n",

I was excited for the meta, and it was great at first then came update after update, screw up after screw up and I couldn\\'t figure out anything. The level system, the blocks, the guns, everything fundamentally changed and it stripped away everything even remotely enjoyable about the game. This game has great potential, but the devs preetty much ran it into the ground for money. I would play this game, PAY for it if it brought back everything to the first stage of the meta, with plenty of customization, a good level system, good gamemodes, and room to grow. Long story short, the devs had something good, something great and ruined it. I\\'m sorry to say that I would NOT reccomend this game.   \n",

I had never played yugioh before and this game was my first experience playing it. You start off with a decent deck (it isn't the best but for learning purposes, its pretty good) with a well known monster of your choice, Blue-Eyes White Dragon or Dark Magician. The gacha mechanic for gettting new cards is great and guarentees rare cards if you're patient enough to use enough gems on it. There is always an event occuring which keeps gameplay fresh. It's an overall great game. Through the game I've come to know and love the whole cast of characters and cards. I would reccomend to new players as well as experienced players.   \n",

But after 1.37 patch, matchmaking isn't history authentic anymore, and new unlocking system making this game hard to open new aircrafts\\tanks (way below limit where you still can get fun). Grind, grind grind. They need to double the exp points(including crew exp) to make this game any interesting to play without premium. On other side premium is too expensive for an average player. I still playing it only because i've got a friends to play with and i've opened almost all USSR and USA crafts before 1.37 was released.So, at current state of matchmaking, prices for premium, and amount of experience point you need to unlock.I don't recommend this game. Maybe check it later, if only they will change their minds about all greedy decisions they made last half year.   \n",

But these past couple years the game has been deteriorating rapidly, Gaijin has been neglecting what the community wants and needs. They have been implementing more and more premium vehicles into the game (which I am not necessarily against) but by doing so they have been letting new players get to the higher tiers, they have gone against their old saying of not letting people buy in to tier 5 instead of earning it. Worst of all, Gaijin has recently mocked their own community with the FPE & Parts debacle. Gaijin has consistently failed to mend damage with the community, and instead are seeking profits rather than a healthy game. While I do understand that the whole business is to make money, it is sad to see a game that the company once seemed they loved and had passion for is now another money making sham. If you want to play this game, go ahead, I imagine you will enjoy tier 1 and 2 but it is not worth putting your money in to, it is not worth putting a lot of energy and love in to.   \n",

Saw it on steam under daybreak instead of SOE and gave it a try with it being free to play which it is. Levelup much easier and with dungeon/group finder it is quick to hop in and do something fun. Just working on a character from 1 to max or where you need to buy a pass/subscription which is only actually needed for the end game material. With as much fun as I've had when I get to that point I will get the extra pass. I wish more people would play this because it is the most content and fun filled free to play game I have found on steam. Have a friend to get to level 20 with and then the game really gets going. Still fun, and for someone new like the friends I play this with the game has plenty of tips and shows the new things going on and how to play. If anything this is at least worth a try.

I spent 20 minutes in the queue for a casual game. and for some reason there is a leavers penalty for a casual game. do not waste your time on this game like I have.   \n",

Not realistic gameplay 2. bad representation of the urban place 3. Pay TO Win 4. incomprehensible menu 5. Noob players 6. You need lot of time to unlock good tanks ( i am not speaking for the PzKw IV ) 7. medium tanks at this game are horrible 8. No realistic range of  the tank ( frome the one side of the map you can destroy a tank that is at the other side )  Thats all , i would not recommend that game     \n",

It's got massive scale battles over 3 continents, gorgeous graphics, rock solid gameplay and a great in-depth skill tree! You can either go infantry and shoot people up close, or decimate the competition by jumping in one of the awesome land or air vehicles. Fight your battle, your way.My tip for new players? Go medic or engineer for quick skillpoint farming, and enjoy! Also be sure to use your microphone, it really helps (though it's not required).   \n",

Some will find ways around it or just enjoyed the incredible vehicle models. But now Gaijin's answer to an unbalanced system is to make it worse.They admitted there was a problem with balance, they made small steps to fix it (such as moving the IS3 so it could no longer fight Panthers and Pershings). But with the 23/9/15 patch they brought the IS3 back so it could face Panthers and Pershings, as well as bringing back every single top tier tank down the same way.1960s Cold War vehicles are now matched against Tiger 2s, IS2s and M26s. Tanks like the Maus and T-10M are absolutely destroying entire teams-worth of players BY THEMSELVES. This whole review hasn't even touched on the mess that is endgame plane content either, with Tempest prop planes getting eaten alive by MiG15s and 1944-era Me262s fighting the cream of the crop from the Korean War the F86 Sabre and MiG15bis.These changes do have an effect on the low tiers but they are less noticeable than the devastating, game-breaking blow that has been dealt to mid-high tier gameplay. I was excited, I was happy, I almost had my M47 Patton. But the game is broken.Given Gaijin's track record it will take at least 3 months to touch on the subject again, and no guarantee to fix it.AVOID.   \n",

Even the UI in the menu is the same - minor tweeks here and there, but overall? probably only about a 10% change on what was here before...Now... let's remember... WarZ was removed from being sold on Steam - for fraud, essentially.With that said... if you loved Infestation Survivor Stories, I'm sure you'll enjoy this - but this game is still complete garbage.  Sergey and his crew, will always, and forever be, a cash and grab group.  They can say, all the way, until they're blue in the face that this is a different company, or whatever - it's the exact same game.  With the exact same GC/P2W model...  I'm going to feel very sorry for whoever drops cash on this...And look how many people are streaming this right now... next to nobody ... the game is still clunky, still garbage, AND, I already found H*cks online for it - so I mean, whatever their \"MLG\" Anti-Hack is... it's crap, still... it's a joke   \n",

I got a legendary (yellow) weapon from a rusted crate and I've never gotten above a blue from gold or higher crates.

I started playing with a lvl 88 promo-code and Luckily I had lots of good stuff from this patch, but for new players it will take them months of nonstop play every day to get anythin good and its unbalanced as hell.   \n",

With the removal of desync, I can proudly say this is easily the best ARPG on the market and given its extremely ethical business model and excellent game developers, there is no reason any fan of rpgs or arpgs alike shouldn't atleast give this game a try.   \n",
       "8770   Early Access ReviewIf you're looking for a good free Battle Royale game, this is worth a try. It's still very early and is still missing a lot, but what is already available is definitely worth playing. While I wasn't a fan of my first game due to lack of real explanation of what anything is, a few more games in and I'm starting to get the hang of things. Setting this in a more MMO/WoW setting is a nice change, but the biggest difference between this and every other similar game I've played is the classes and abilities. While you do still spend your time figuring out where to drop and looking for loot, you can take the loot you don't like, discard it for shards, and use those shards to craft items at forges located around the map. Everyone having a mount can speed up movement quite a bit, but doesn't make the map feel any smaller when you do it. The downsides right now to me are when you are near a fight, everything is fine, but if you aren't, you can sometimes see gunshots and explosions in the distance but don't hear any sound at all. I also haven't heard any footsteps from other players unless they were on a mount, which cuts down on situational awareness. The lack of proper descriptions on things, especially abilities, can make things really confusing, but it's not too hard to figure out. I'm also waiting for more personality to be added. Running around as a chicken after you've been downed is cute and different, but lack of customization on characters, armor not really showing on people when you see them, and no emotes makes it feel a bit soulless, but I'm positive that stuff will be added in later.Definitely worth a try and I'm looking forward to seeing how it does. It's nice to have a more fantasy themed BR where I don't have to worry about building. Fortnite and PUBG are fine, but this kind of fills the hole that Radical Heights left in my heart.   \n",

This game offers so much, but it's rather difficult to get into, while being incredibly easy to get in to. Starting the game and exploring is fun and you can do it from day one, at first glance it's a fun game, but nothing you'd spent much time on. Now If you look past that, there is actually so much. The leveling system isn't what determines a character. Maxed stats are. In game \"potions\" are used as a sort of currency in the trading economy, along with gear and other items. These potions are obtained by defeating difficult enemies and completeing certain dungeons.  To problem is, getting this far takes practice, detrmination and grit. Death is inevitable, dont let it set you back. Learning how to rebound from deaths becomes an integral feature as you make characters that are more and more powerful. Even the most powerful characters who have all 8 stats maxed are prone to quick deaths, the game in unforgiving, and requires skill, but offers much in return for those who deliver.   \n",
