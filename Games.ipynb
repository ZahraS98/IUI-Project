I've come to the conclusion that yes, the gameplay is fun, it can be fun with friends, and it is rewarding sometimes, I highly do not recommend it to new people. The community is 16 shades of toxic, the report system is, the best I can describe it, extremely useless, as well, it just shows a total lack of effort from Valve, and their lack of effort to improve the community. One person on your team feeding and raging? Oh well, unless people from another game report him, he's probably not getting low priority. If you play more than one match of Dota a day, you'll probably run out of the allotted weekly reports (3) rather quickly, and the only way to get more within the week is if they act upon the person you report. I've had multiple games with people feeding, spam pinging, or being toxic as hell in general. Whole team reports them, nothing happens. The report was wasted and it feels like a suggestion box connected directly to a trash can. The low priority system just needs to be completely redone. The whole thing is ineffectual, and usually ends up being one maybe two people in the game who got low priority because of Internet problems (I've suffered from quite a few of these and thus my knowledge of the hell that is low priority), while the rest are ragers, spam pingers, and feeders. Yes Dota has very intellegent gameplay, and tons of depth and can be hours and hours of replayable fun, however, with the community how it is, the terrible punishment/report system, and valve's total lack in interest to fix any problems that aren't related to making money, I have to recommend you not download Dota 2</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Six Steps of CheesemakingAcidification: Starter culture is added to milk to change lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid. This process changes the acidity level of the milk and begins the process of turning milk from a liquid into a solid.Coagulation: Rennet is added to further encourage the milk to solidify.Curds and Whey: Curds are cut using a knife or a tool that resembles a rake. Cutting the curds further encourages them to expel liquid or whey. Generally, the smaller the curds are cut, the harder the resulting cheese will be. Soft cheeses like Camembert or Brie are hardly cut at all. Harder cheeses like Cheddar and Gruyere are cut into a very fine texture. For these harder cheeses, the curds are further manipulated by cheddaring and/or cooking. Cooking the curd changes its texture, making it tender rather than crumbly.Salting: Salt adds flavor and also acts as a preservative so the cheese does not spoil during long months or years of aging also helps a natural rind to form on the cheese. There are several ways to use salt. Salt can be added directly into the curd as the cheese is being made. The outside of the wheel of cheese can be rubbed with salt or with a damp cloth that has been soaked in brine. The cheese can also be bathed directly in vat of brine.Shaping: The cheese is put into a basket or a mold to form it into a specific shape. During this process, the cheese is also pressed with weights or a machine to expel any remaining liquid.Ripening: Referred to as affinage, this process ages cheese until it reaches optimal ripeness. During this process, the temperature and humidity of the cave or room where the cheese ages is closely monitored. An experienced affineur knows how to properly treat each cheese so it develops the proper flavor and texture. For some cheeses, ambient molds in the air give the cheese a distinct flavor. For others, mold is introduced by spraying it on the cheese (brie) or injecting it into the cheese (blue cheese). Some cheeses must be turned, some must be brushed with oil, and some must be washed with brine or alcohol.</td>\n",

       "      <td>TL/DR Time to set some innacurate information straight. For actual review about the game features, see the archive of my other reviews in the link at the end.I've seen a few negative reviews that, in my opinion, share inacurate information.  As such, this review will serve as a rectification.Pay to win, pay to speed up and yes, even pay for oreThese are all untrue: Ore cannot be purchased, it's extracted for free in the game world using Extractors (3 varieties with increased yield and speed). There has also been some positive adjustment to increase Iron yield and ease of mining since it was argued to be the rarest or hardest to find.Unlike mobile games, there is no option to speed up cooldowns and such by paying money. Instead, you are encouraged to get better gear by progressing through the crafting system that's more efficient (mining cell, extractors). As for the processor/forges, there is no limit to the number you can have working concurently and you can now feed them 5 items in a single Shift+Click (so instead of filling one with 20 clicks, why not Shift+Click 4 that will be done 4x faster!).Pay to win applies traditionaly to games that are competitive by nature and where you can buy an edge that free player could not compete with.  Even assuming this loosely apply to this type of game : Flash light can be replaced with free light sources (that even prevent monster spawning, where the flash light does not) ; Increased stamina can be gotten through food and is purely optional to build ; Glider allow to reach high places... but so does jumping and placing blocks below yourself.Need to pay to create a worldThat is simply innacurate : Every free players get one world, no matter how much it really cost to maintain them hosted on servers. Free players can also play on any public world (not protect by password or realeased as \"public world\") owned by other.  If you've made a huge mistake and want to start anew, there is a function that allows you to reset your world.Microtransactions paywallThe available content for free : ALL published adventures, ALL blueprints (on the off chance they use blocks you don't have yet, these can be substituted for others), ALL machines, ALL tools, ALL the natural blocks and ore you can find in the world, ALL armors, ALL weapon except one (and it's not the best one), ALL the creatures and their loot (that can be tamed as pet), ALL the available food recipes, ALL potions, the major part of all crafted blocks (including blocks, slopes/roof, stairs, doors, ladders, fences, furniture, light source and chests).The content available for purchace : A few sets of blocks that are purely optional and that a lot of players will allow you to try for free.All in all, I'd be surprised if someone made a formal analysis of quantitative free vs paid content... pretty sure it'd be below 10% (and probably by far).Minecraft cloneI simply don't understand that one.  There are lots of game out there that share similarities to other game (most war games, most FPS games, etc)... a lot of other people have made great argument about this subject : check the forums (incliding Minecraft being itself a clone of Infiniminer or some such).NB : An archive of my reviews can be found in this guide. Some of you may get the joke on the title.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599985987</td>\n",

Despite the title, the initial appearance of the game isn't that of a horror title, even the first scares that you come across are cutely designed cardboard cutouts that pop out from walls as you walk by. As you progress, the game truly comes into its own, changing the scenery, music and overall atmosphere to continually put you in a state of unease. With a whole host of \"specimens\" trying to scare/kill you, an adorable antogonist, outstanding sound and an ability to deliver an unnerving experience (not to mention the fact that this game is free) should put ths game way up on the lists of anyone looking for a decent horror game.</td>\n",

Like, A LOT. I've come to the conclusion that yes, the gameplay is fun, it can be fun with friends, and it is rewarding sometimes, I highly do not recommend it to new people. The community is 16 shades of toxic, the report system is, the best I can describe it, extremely useless, as well, it just shows a total lack of effort from Valve, and their lack of effort to improve the community. One person on your team feeding and raging? Oh well, unless people from another game report him, he's probably not getting low priority. If you play more than one match of Dota a day, you'll probably run out of the allotted weekly reports (3) rather quickly, and the only way to get more within the week is if they act upon the person you report. I've had multiple games with people feeding, spam pinging, or being toxic as hell in general. Whole team reports them, nothing happens. The report was wasted and it feels like a suggestion box connected directly to a trash can. The low priority system just needs to be completely redone. The whole thing is ineffectual, and usually ends up being one maybe two people in the game who got low priority because of Internet problems (I've suffered from quite a few of these and thus my knowledge of the hell that is low priority), while the rest are ragers, spam pingers, and feeders. Yes Dota has very intellegent gameplay, and tons of depth and can be hours and hours of replayable fun, however, with the community how it is, the terrible punishment/report system, and valve's total lack in interest to fix any problems that aren't related to making money, I have to recommend you not download Dota 2   \n",

The downside is that progress can slow down a lot after a while since some planned features seem to be missing, it's a bit too reliant on RNG, and it eats up a lot more memory than it probably should, but hopefully those issues will get ironed out over time.   \n",

This process changes the acidity level of the milk and begins the process of turning milk from a liquid into a solid.Coagulation: Rennet is added to further encourage the milk to solidify.Curds and Whey: Curds are cut using a knife or a tool that resembles a rake. Cutting the curds further encourages them to expel liquid or whey. Generally, the smaller the curds are cut, the harder the resulting cheese will be. Soft cheeses like Camembert or Brie are hardly cut at all. Harder cheeses like Cheddar and Gruyere are cut into a very fine texture. For these harder cheeses, the curds are further manipulated by cheddaring and/or cooking. Cooking the curd changes its texture, making it tender rather than crumbly.Salting: Salt adds flavor and also acts as a preservative so the cheese does not spoil during long months or years of aging also helps a natural rind to form on the cheese. There are several ways to use salt. Salt can be added directly into the curd as the cheese is being made. The outside of the wheel of cheese can be rubbed with salt or with a damp cloth that has been soaked in brine. The cheese can also be bathed directly in vat of brine.Shaping: The cheese is put into a basket or a mold to form it into a specific shape. During this process, the cheese is also pressed with weights or a machine to expel any remaining liquid.Ripening: Referred to as affinage, this process ages cheese until it reaches optimal ripeness. During this process, the temperature and humidity of the cave or room where the cheese ages is closely monitored. An experienced affineur knows how to properly treat each cheese so it develops the proper flavor and texture. For some cheeses, ambient molds in the air give the cheese a distinct flavor. For others, mold is introduced by spraying it on the cheese (brie) or injecting it into the cheese (blue cheese). Some cheeses must be turned, some must be brushed with oil, and some must be washed with brine or alcohol.   \n",

       "13608  TL/DR Time to set some innacurate information straight. For actual review about the game features, see the archive of my other reviews in the link at the end.I've seen a few negative reviews that, in my opinion, share inacurate information.  As such, this review will serve as a rectification.Pay to win, pay to speed up and yes, even pay for oreThese are all untrue: Ore cannot be purchased, it's extracted for free in the game world using Extractors (3 varieties with increased yield and speed). There has also been some positive adjustment to increase Iron yield and ease of mining since it was argued to be the rarest or hardest to find.Unlike mobile games, there is no option to speed up cooldowns and such by paying money. Instead, you are encouraged to get better gear by progressing through the crafting system that's more efficient (mining cell, extractors). As for the processor/forges, there is no limit to the number you can have working concurently and you can now feed them 5 items in a single Shift+Click (so instead of filling one with 20 clicks, why not Shift+Click 4 that will be done 4x faster!).Pay to win applies traditionaly to games that are competitive by nature and where you can buy an edge that free player could not compete with.  Even assuming this loosely apply to this type of game : Flash light can be replaced with free light sources (that even prevent monster spawning, where the flash light does not) ; Increased stamina can be gotten through food and is purely optional to build ; Glider allow to reach high places... but so does jumping and placing blocks below yourself.Need to pay to create a worldThat is simply innacurate : Every free players get one world, no matter how much it really cost to maintain them hosted on servers. Free players can also play on any public world (not protect by password or realeased as \"public world\") owned by other.  If you've made a huge mistake and want to start anew, there is a function that allows you to reset your world.Microtransactions paywallThe available content for free : ALL published adventures, ALL blueprints (on the off chance they use blocks you don't have yet, these can be substituted for others), ALL machines, ALL tools, ALL the natural blocks and ore you can find in the world, ALL armors, ALL weapon except one (and it's not the best one), ALL the creatures and their loot (that can be tamed as pet), ALL the available food recipes, ALL potions, the major part of all crafted blocks (including blocks, slopes/roof, stairs, doors, ladders, fences, furniture, light source and chests).The content available for purchace : A few sets of blocks that are purely optional and that a lot of players will allow you to try for free.All in all, I'd be surprised if someone made a formal analysis of quantitative free vs paid content... pretty sure it'd be below 10% (and probably by far).Minecraft cloneI simply don't understand that one.  There are lots of game out there that share similarities to other game (most war games, most FPS games, etc)... a lot of other people have made great argument about this subject : check the forums (incliding Minecraft being itself a clone of Infiniminer or some such).NB : An archive of my reviews can be found in this guide. Some of you may get the joke on the title.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599985987    \n",

Nearly 200 hours in, having done every single thing to do in this game, having opened over 100 lunchboxes, I only got 2 legendary dwellers out of them.  I still need 15 more for the last achievements, at a 2% rate, that's 750 more lunchboxes..you do the math.   \n",

And then it flips the whole thing on its head and you're running for your life from terrible monsters with a deplenishing stamina meter.   \n",

Go read what the devs think about their long time players. Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I tried to stay in and support them but this latest update is just stupid. The attitude of the developers is horrible and the community is going down fast. Very dissapointing to say the least. It used to be a great game full of creativity. Not so much now.

Now, without the pro version you cant get the \"full\" experence out of the game. #bringbackfreetoplay   \n",

I've played most of the free online trading card games and this is the only one i've felt like i can stick to and enjoy for long periods. Cards are easy to obtain with daily rewards. Only down side is the player base. A game every 30 seconds to 1 minute isn't bad but i've fought like 10 different people over and over in the bronze/silver rankings. All in all it's my favorite so far and i approve of this game.   \n",

Despite the title, the initial appearance of the game isn't that of a horror title, even the first scares that you come across are cutely designed cardboard cutouts that pop out from walls as you walk by. As you progress, the game truly comes into its own, changing the scenery, music and overall atmosphere to continually put you in a state of unease. With a whole host of \"specimens\" trying to scare/kill you, an adorable antogonist, outstanding sound and an ability to deliver an unnerving experience (not to mention the fact that this game is free) should put ths game way up on the lists of anyone looking for a decent horror game.   \n",
