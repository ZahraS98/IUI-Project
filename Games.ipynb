All enchants (r10/p), orange artys and weapons, and armor endgame, all boons, pink companions, main companion (Stone of Allure) slotted with r10, and spec’d for pvp..  Yes I had typed Days, of real, total, in-game, gameplay hours (tpye: \"/played\" in-game).. **Fun fact** NW wasn’t originally apart of steam when it was released. It wasn’t until sometime around The Shadowmantle expansion that this game was added into steams store. Which was well after the games release/beta, and well before coming to Xbox One.^^^Believe me when I type no veterans gameplay hours will be represented accurately on a steam account. It’s simply not possible at this point to converge the two coherently. And I would be happy to play my classes if I do get any messages.. But,Moving along, exactly why wasn’t the NW Beta/game originally apart of Steam when other games like NWK were in Steams shop prior to their releases you ask??Well Good question, maybe ask the Devs?? But I’m sure they’ll just      make some story up anyways.. Think about it, they are The Wizards of The Coast ;)Which honestly doesn’t mean that what they have here is a failure at making an extremely fun mmo for new players in the DnD world.. Or to existing fans of the DnD community. Because it’s in fact the opposite, and very fun.. But until one beats the game, reaches max level, clears all more difficult-dungeon versions over and beats modules grinds over and over and over…and reaches end game gear...and does it all over for a seperate toon.. Will I also be able to say for a fact, that you would've had to have dug real deep down into that pocket of yours if you’re just an average-Joe gamer.... only wanting 5 hrs of gameplay to beat a game or else you must know a dev. \"Don’t just wait there though at max lvl, you can do much more!! Do it again, all of it?\"Get a new class, new arty, lvl an arty, lvl a companion, Wait until Summer, realize how minor differences in refining and grinding, and exploiting, can save you money, or Wait until Winter, Halloween, or put the money to better use in most cases of this games mechanics, event rotations.. or realize why the game blancing still feels broken… imbalanced.. In most areas.. after it all\"Do it all over!!!\" because your satisfaction won’t stop untill you have everything (NeverWil). People will try to take from you along the way, websites, players, but mainly it won’t stop because the devs will show no remose for your petty little 40days of gameplay... or petty little 10$. The devs will forever grindout as much money as they can from f2P NW (p2W-NW), simply because they can.. and because NW is no COD, Because one day. NW will die.No one plays it again... the day all devs fear but know lays someday in their games not-to-distant-future. The day No one plays their game (buys currency).Not because it wasnt fun... but for all the reasons above.Ill stop my official review there.. and just comment briefly.. I think anyone reading this game should know the above.. Read this review, and if not play and discuss this with me.. at least with another equally tiered end game.. Read this Before you begin to make very poor financial decisions. Or even talk to someone equally knowledgeable about how to attain most things w/o such terrible financial decisions. NW isn’t worth it.. Look at the real world of games... does any of your real gaming friends care a bout this game??They shouldnt.. and apparently.. ive been able to make it out only before Valandra’s 6th snare feeling not too terribly about it all.. Read this not because of any my many merits in-game.........#Founder(guild rank6).But because its good to know.. Especially when youre new to NW, the warning will be RARE. especially when it comes from someone who has burnt a hole in themselves b/c of this game and learnt much along the way.. RP 101 = Artifact _TYPE to Artifact_TYPE b/c Anyone can do a lot more with the amount of time and money that ive spent on this f2p than me. Which dosent include Free-Warnings.. Even when the expenditures flows right back into the gaming genre.. NW will never burn Bright.dont buy ur bro a computer.. dont buy f2P devs a computer...The candle of f2p's (NW) dies out for a reason.. and it was honestly as clear as a crystal the whole time. its in front of you.. you must be the one to see it... if you cant see it,  then this review wont even mean anything anyways.. and you were doomed from the start. You would only share the same end as me. You would see things for what they were when it was too late, and attempt to warn the other horses of the danger. You know you'll fail to come accross to the right ones and yet wouldn't change anything if you could go back to the day you found out about NW either.. It was your decision to dry out the games content as far as you did and beacuse the content is still so sandy, and dry you shall never care again.. #FreeWarning??Its also good to know to not buy this games content from steam... there have been major redemption errors previously. Steam isnt affiliated with PWE, go to pwe.com.. its f2p.. Dont Buy      Anything!!!Again I will warn you the path ahead if you chose to peruse NW... you will,  eventually, Find your cross broken.. and possibly Burnt-out...much like many f2p gamers before you or me..Consider this a fair warning =))“RDxKa0s offers us aid, let us not foolishly resist it.”-NeverWinter Commoner</td>\n",

It's like Diablo 3 but darker and a more grittier feel. Story- You are exiled and left in a continent or place called Wraeclast. You venture out in dungeons, caves, ruins, jungle, and other locale in Wraeclast.Gameplay- You select various classes: Maurauder (melee/tank), Duelist (Hybrid of melee/range), Ranger (Archer), Witch (Mage), Templar (Hybrid), and a Scion (unlock after 1st act). So there is a character for just about any play-style. Destroy the many hordes of creatures in Wraeclast to gain experience and level up. You get nice loot based on the enemies you kill or quests you complete. You get to use special colored components to enhance your weapons and gear. And PoE boasts a massive skill tree that I have ever seen in games. The skill tree is like an extension to the colored components, but you can specifically add points to certain attributes. Online/Co-op- There is some co-op play, but keep in mind you have to be close in level with other players. There are guilds to join. You can trade some of your gear with other players. There's also PvP, and often times tournaments you can qualify for to make the game challenging. Cons- Minor gripe is for some not so good netcoding. You think your character is at one point on a level, but a split millisecond, his/her position was somewhere else, as if he teleported. It can get confusing, sometimes frustrating when dealing with a mob of enemies. But it's a minor gripe.Conclusion: If you like Diablo games, give this a try. Game has a bit of a learning curve to it, but there are plenty of guides, and helpful people that can get you started or keep you moving on. There's plenty to do. The game today is completely different from when it was first available. Most importantly, the game is FREE!! The only time money would be spent is for purely cosmetic enhancements to your character. This was the first game I ever put over 100 hours into on Steam, and it was worth it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>If this MMO had been released in 2008, it would of been a below average MMO of its day, in 2018, it is a very poor addition to the genre. They have designed a game without any forward thinking, or even what works with classic MMOs.Having some great features that work in other games may help, but forgetting to include ancillary systems leaves them dead in the water. It is hard to believe how bad this game is, with so much money invested into it and how long it spent in development hell. The engine is so dated and is not at all optimised, so much so, that even with this game, with graphics that look like something from about 12 years ago or more, after setting everything to minimum (1), it still stutters and drops frames, showing how little love or care was put into this game. Compare this to BDO for graphical fidelity and performance, the difference is night and day.Leaving that, and the game place, spending the first 10 mins in a game like this and you will start to know if you will hate it or at least like it a little, this game was unintuitive. Play any game from Warhammer Online, WoW, etc. and you will straight away be able to jump in and start messing about, but with this it is clunky.I could go on about some of the other systems that they have in place, but, I think you get the picture, I was looking forward to some fun but I found none here, I would advise others to look elsewhere too.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SMITE OverviewThis game is unlike any other MOBA games such as League of Legends and Dota 2. It has Third Person View, instead of the birds eye view you normally get with a typical MOBA game. The third person view is what initially made me want to try this game out.  I have put in over 300+ hours worth of gameplay and is one of  my favorite games i have played on PC so far.My friends believed that the game was just like another typical MOBA game but it is not! after my friends tried SMITE, we couldn't stop playing it.There are many different types of gods you can play as such as Guardian, Assassin, Warrior, Mage and Hunter. SMITE is Not a pay to win game, although you can buy additional in game currency [GEMS]. They are not needed unless you want to buy additional cosmetics that make your gods look better in certain aspects. Some times Hi-Rez releases events that are some times payed for with GEMS and some times which are free. the event enables you to either buy or work your way towards unlocking the specified unlockable, depending on the event.Hi-Rez continuously update SMITE which they bring out all new and exiting stuff such as Gods, Loading Frames, Voice Packs, BUG Fixes and Re-Works on characters. Hi-Rez also have just intoduced Recalling Skins. I haven't come across any exploites so far, hopefully it stays that way.I mainly play two game modes called Conquest and Joust. Conquest is a 5v5 game mode with 3 lanes a solo lane, a mid lane and a long lane and with jungles either sides. Joust is a 3v3 gamemode with one lane and one side of a jungle.There is a Competitive Ranked Play on SMITE but in order to access the ranked play, you must be level 30 and have mastered 18 gods for Conquest and 16 for Joust. the ranked play is much better than casual because its competitive. also you can also gain advantages by banning specified gods, in which you are unable to do so in casual. ProsThe Pros of SMITE are:+ Many gods to play as+ Competitive Play+ Great MOBA game+ Third Person View+ Continuously Updated+ Easy To Run+ Free To Play+ Not Pay To Win+ Many Events+ Cosmetic Items only+ Great Community+ Great Gameplay+ Great Graphics ConsThe Cons of SMITE are:- Sometimes get bad matchups in casual matchmaking- Not Easy To Level Up- Sometimes The Launcher Is A Bit Buggy ConclusionLastly i rate this game 10/10 and i recommend for people to try this game. The game overall is a brilliant game and i hope more people get involved with the game and to see more people enjoy it.  I hope this review helped, and developers keep up the good work.</td>\n",

                                                pretty much the only hunting game that takes a stap at not being a fast passed arcade shooter.been playing for years and i keep goin back. the range of hunting areas, species and hunting techniques mean you can keep the repetivity at bay.new content is fairly regular but the game overall is expensive. a membership is about £20 thats not bad but a new rifle will cost you £5 and their is so much  stuff to buy. and this game is NOT free to play. you can  play but its more of an on goig demo you will get 1 basic gun and 1 basic shotgun and 2 species on a rotation. its access to the tip of the iceberg to see if its for you.   \n",

Why mobile game on Steam? I remember playing original World of Tanks couple of years ago.I grinded so ♥♥♥♥ing hard to get better tier tank. Matches took so long and you were getting so little experience and credits. I finally managed to get to tier 5! American M4 Sherman IIRC... only to realize how much that tank sucked. And then I saw how much more grinding was before me in a bad tank to get anything better.Thanks, but NO! WoT is awful!Then I played the mobile version on my phone and had many more tanks in shorter time, also grabbed free tank slots on promos, so I'm not that limited. This game looks rather bad, is dumbed down, but it's at least a bit more REASONABLE in GRINDING FEST.It could be better, but it's still fun, especially that you can play on mobile and have same account. Game still requires a LOT of grinding though.   \n",
       "8044   You'll want to... Skim this review b/c**No biases**<<Many toons<24k TR**Main-class**, 60days. All enchants (r10/p), orange artys and weapons, and armor endgame, all boons, pink companions, main companion (Stone of Allure) slotted with r10, and spec’d for pvp..  Yes I had typed Days, of real, total, in-game, gameplay hours (tpye: \"/played\" in-game).. **Fun fact** NW wasn’t originally apart of steam when it was released. It wasn’t until sometime around The Shadowmantle expansion that this game was added into steams store. Which was well after the games release/beta, and well before coming to Xbox One.^^^Believe me when I type no veterans gameplay hours will be represented accurately on a steam account. It’s simply not possible at this point to converge the two coherently. And I would be happy to play my classes if I do get any messages.. But,Moving along, exactly why wasn’t the NW Beta/game originally apart of Steam when other games like NWK were in Steams shop prior to their releases you ask??Well Good question, maybe ask the Devs?? But I’m sure they’ll just      make some story up anyways.. Think about it, they are The Wizards of The Coast ;)Which honestly doesn’t mean that what they have here is a failure at making an extremely fun mmo for new players in the DnD world.. Or to existing fans of the DnD community. Because it’s in fact the opposite, and very fun.. But until one beats the game, reaches max level, clears all more difficult-dungeon versions over and beats modules grinds over and over and over…and reaches end game gear...and does it all over for a seperate toon.. Will I also be able to say for a fact, that you would've had to have dug real deep down into that pocket of yours if you’re just an average-Joe gamer.... only wanting 5 hrs of gameplay to beat a game or else you must know a dev. \"Don’t just wait there though at max lvl, you can do much more!! Do it again, all of it?\"Get a new class, new arty, lvl an arty, lvl a companion, Wait until Summer, realize how minor differences in refining and grinding, and exploiting, can save you money, or Wait until Winter, Halloween, or put the money to better use in most cases of this games mechanics, event rotations.. or realize why the game blancing still feels broken… imbalanced.. In most areas.. after it all\"Do it all over!!!\" because your satisfaction won’t stop untill you have everything (NeverWil). People will try to take from you along the way, websites, players, but mainly it won’t stop because the devs will show no remose for your petty little 40days of gameplay... or petty little 10$. The devs will forever grindout as much money as they can from f2P NW (p2W-NW), simply because they can.. and because NW is no COD, Because one day. NW will die.No one plays it again... the day all devs fear but know lays someday in their games not-to-distant-future. The day No one plays their game (buys currency).Not because it wasnt fun... but for all the reasons above.Ill stop my official review there.. and just comment briefly.. I think anyone reading this game should know the above.. Read this review, and if not play and discuss this with me.. at least with another equally tiered end game.. Read this Before you begin to make very poor financial decisions. Or even talk to someone equally knowledgeable about how to attain most things w/o such terrible financial decisions. NW isn’t worth it.. Look at the real world of games... does any of your real gaming friends care a bout this game??They shouldnt.. and apparently.. ive been able to make it out only before Valandra’s 6th snare feeling not too terribly about it all.. Read this not because of any my many merits in-game.........#Founder(guild rank6).But because its good to know.. Especially when youre new to NW, the warning will be RARE. especially when it comes from someone who has burnt a hole in themselves b/c of this game and learnt much along the way.. RP 101 = Artifact _TYPE to Artifact_TYPE b/c Anyone can do a lot more with the amount of time and money that ive spent on this f2p than me. Which dosent include Free-Warnings.. Even when the expenditures flows right back into the gaming genre.. NW will never burn Bright.dont buy ur bro a computer.. dont buy f2P devs a computer...The candle of f2p's (NW) dies out for a reason.. and it was honestly as clear as a crystal the whole time. its in front of you.. you must be the one to see it... if you cant see it,  then this review wont even mean anything anyways.. and you were doomed from the start. You would only share the same end as me. You would see things for what they were when it was too late, and attempt to warn the other horses of the danger. You know you'll fail to come accross to the right ones and yet wouldn't change anything if you could go back to the day you found out about NW either.. It was your decision to dry out the games content as far as you did and beacuse the content is still so sandy, and dry you shall never care again.. #FreeWarning??Its also good to know to not buy this games content from steam... there have been major redemption errors previously.

It's like Diablo 3 but darker and a more grittier feel. Story- You are exiled and left in a continent or place called Wraeclast. You venture out in dungeons, caves, ruins, jungle, and other locale in Wraeclast.Gameplay- You select various classes: Maurauder (melee/tank), Duelist (Hybrid of melee/range), Ranger (Archer), Witch (Mage), Templar (Hybrid), and a Scion (unlock after 1st act). So there is a character for just about any play-style. Destroy the many hordes of creatures in Wraeclast to gain experience and level up. You get nice loot based on the enemies you kill or quests you complete. You get to use special colored components to enhance your weapons and gear. And PoE boasts a massive skill tree that I have ever seen in games. The skill tree is like an extension to the colored components, but you can specifically add points to certain attributes. Online/Co-op- There is some co-op play, but keep in mind you have to be close in level with other players. There are guilds to join. You can trade some of your gear with other players. There's also PvP, and often times tournaments you can qualify for to make the game challenging. Cons- Minor gripe is for some not so good netcoding. You think your character is at one point on a level, but a split millisecond, his/her position was somewhere else, as if he teleported. It can get confusing, sometimes frustrating when dealing with a mob of enemies. But it's a minor gripe.Conclusion: If you like Diablo games, give this a try. Game has a bit of a learning curve to it, but there are plenty of guides, and helpful people that can get you started or keep you moving on. There's plenty to do. The game today is completely different from when it was first available. Most importantly, the game is FREE!! The only time money would be spent is for purely cosmetic enhancements to your character. This was the first game I ever put over 100 hours into on Steam, and it was worth it.   \n",

has not gotten a single extra map, update, game mode or even penalties for leaving. i played right on launch also..... the pve is fun the spells are to and dungeons but all boses seem to just spawn more and more adds and thats the end of the fight they are hard though! 5/10   \n",

years ago.During some Updates it changed alot but it always had 9 different classes alot of opportunitis and possible playstiles and make me have alot of fun every day.Since the last update alot of things changed you now playing in ranked gamemeodes comparable to the CS:GO stuff but not as good as CS:GO ranks. But still: you could enjoy playing on these Valve ranked servers or just go out and play on a community server.Always alot of fun and I would recommend it everyone   \n",

                                       Early Access ReviewThis game idea is very very good, Ill give the developers that, but in other ways it is extremely bad. 1. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN NVIDIA DO NOT GET THIS GAMEThe game is optimized through something called PhysX which can only run efficiently on NVIDIA. If you have anything other than NVIDIA you will experience around 15 frames per second ON A GOOD DAY. 2. THIS GAME IS PAY TO WIN LIKE MANY OTHERS HAVE SAID   \n",

This is what I have to say:-= PROS =--Great Art Style-Like the 2.5D (As some call it) Yet also dislike it because it can mess with the PvP function such as skills not going around a corner or something-Good Game concept-Characters are fun to play along with their lore-Community (Helpful, and have those salty kids from time to time)-= CONS =--Compared to the Korean Reigon, Japan, Void (Private Server) the NA scenes DEVs are Money Whor**s (I don't throw that around lightly)-This includes their costumor support (Ushally a bot mesasge or something which I can understand but the way they go about dealing with it is just rude sometimes-Costumization (Item Mall Costumes (Ushally look♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to IBs & Ice Burners which are the CSGO Case of Elsword and cost a fortune for a full set)-Certain Characters are broken for PvE (CBS & Optimus) and others for PvPOverall I do like the games conccept and game mechanics however dislike the Developers with a buring passion and there customer support. The community is very helpful, and they have made the game less of a grind as it used to be very much so. They have made good improvments yet also ones that aren't. Final Thought: If you're able to play on a KR Account do so, NA is just cancer sometimes WITH♥♥♥♥♥♥DEVS. This isn't a through review however I do reccomend giving the game a go. My Chung Deadly Chaser <3 is my reason to keep playing the game (Even if most my friends have quit)   \n",

                                                 dont really know whether i should recommend this game or not cause it has big potential but the developer misstreated it, you need money to unlock certain stuff (not pay to win though) and its really hard to get in. Getting good equipment dropped (no matter if the stats are the ones you need) take longer than just buying what you want from better player. It also dont get many updates. Id love to love this game but i cant   \n",

then this is the one for you.Basically its just like any other space shooter which i find very rare for a decent gameplay like this.This one is a rare one i would say. Not because it has some big♥♥♥♥♥ships flyin around devastating others. Because its like a MOBA with ships and lasers~So play this game if you :~so hyped about space shooters~bored of the conventional MOBAs~just wanna play it~bored afp/s:do get some friends while playing bcs it will make it a lot easier :3   \n",

Once you have won for a number of games, the system starts to assign players with extremly bad behaviours to you. No matter how hard you try to win, the certain players will just automatically losing you the game.  It is not like they give you stronger enemeies when you are winning,  Or just drop a pro players in 4k rank game and ruin others game experience.   \n",

i would not play steam beecause i would think this is a trash game store trying to skame me, maby making me think all of steam free to play are trash so why crate a game to click the whole time making

I have been around since Planetside 1. All the way from Meteor showers and flying tanks to what we have today. I easily have over 2000 hours played on this game. I don´t often write a review, but when I do, it´s gonna be good.Planetside 2 sustains itself with \"Money Whales\" such as I. I spent probably 300 -350€ (including membership) on this game. You see the word \"membership\"? Dont worry, all it gives you is a juicy Exp boost and makes earning certs (in game money) less of a burden.You see \"Micro Transactions\"? Dont worry. EVERY weapon in the game can be unlocked without paying a single cent, the micro transactions are purely Cosmetic (color, style changes, but still the same weapon...), or if you wish to unlock a weapon sooner!When you start, dont let the chaos and confusion discourage you. The tutorial is weak at its best and videos on youtube are scarce and not really fulfilling in information. Get in game, play, make mistakes, learn from the mistakes, repeat. You see \"In game currency grind\"? Dont worry, as soon as you get into the game and you arent a simple minded russian zerger then you can easily get 100+ certs the hour. EASILY. For earning certs the only thing you need to do is literally staw away from the center of a zerg. The only negative thing i can say about this game is the Physics. So broken, too op, please fix.   \n",

hell is going to manually back up their saves every time? My computer froze once while starting this up and came back to my save game gone. This game is both a waste of time and money, i played not only to have my my progress lost but also money spent in their store wasted.    \n",

They have designed a game without any forward thinking, or even what works with classic MMOs.Having some great features that work in other games may help, but forgetting to include ancillary systems leaves them dead in the water. It is hard to believe how bad this game is, with so much money invested into it and how long it spent in development hell. The engine is so dated and is not at all optimised, so much so, that even with this game, with graphics that look like something from about 12 years ago or more, after setting everything to minimum (1), it still stutters and drops frames, showing how little love or care was put into this game. Compare this to BDO for graphical fidelity and performance, the difference is night and day.Leaving that, and the game place, spending the first 10 mins in a game like this and you will start to know if you will hate it or at least like it a little, this game was unintuitive. Play any game from Warhammer Online, WoW, etc. and you will straight away be able to jump in and start messing about, but with this it is clunky.I could go on about some of the other systems that they have in place, but, I think you get the picture, I was looking forward to some fun but I found none here, I would advise others to look elsewhere too.    \n",

It has Third Person View, instead of the birds eye view you normally get with a typical MOBA game. The third person view is what initially made me want to try this game out.  I have put in over 300+ hours worth of gameplay and is one of  my favorite games i have played on PC so far.My friends believed that the game was just like another typical MOBA game but it is not! after my friends tried SMITE, we couldn't stop playing it.There are many different types of gods you can play as such as Guardian, Assassin, Warrior, Mage and Hunter. SMITE is Not a pay to win game, although you can buy additional in game currency [GEMS]. They are not needed unless you want to buy additional cosmetics that make your gods look better in certain aspects. Some times Hi-Rez releases events that are some times payed for with GEMS and some times which are free. the event enables you to either buy or work your way towards unlocking the specified unlockable, depending on the event.Hi-Rez continuously update SMITE which they bring out all new and exiting stuff such as Gods, Loading Frames, Voice Packs, BUG Fixes and Re-Works on characters. Hi-Rez also have just intoduced Recalling Skins. I haven't come across any exploites so far, hopefully it stays that way.I mainly play two game modes called Conquest and Joust. Conquest is a 5v5 game mode with 3 lanes a solo lane, a mid lane and a long lane and with jungles either sides. Joust is a 3v3 gamemode with one lane and one side of a jungle.There is a Competitive Ranked Play on SMITE but in order to access the ranked play, you must be level 30 and have mastered 18 gods for Conquest and 16 for Joust. the ranked play is much better than casual because its competitive. also you can also gain advantages by banning specified gods, in which you are unable to do so in casual. ProsThe Pros of SMITE are:+ Many gods to play as+ Competitive Play+ Great MOBA game+ Third Person View+ Continuously Updated+ Easy To Run+ Free To Play+ Not Pay To Win+ Many Events+ Cosmetic Items only+ Great Community+ Great Gameplay+ Great Graphics ConsThe Cons of SMITE are:- Sometimes get bad matchups in casual matchmaking- Not Easy To Level Up- Sometimes The Launcher Is A Bit Buggy ConclusionLastly i rate this game 10/10 and i recommend for people to try this game. The game overall is a brilliant game and i hope more people get involved with the game and to see more people enjoy it.  I hope this review helped, and developers keep up the good work.   \n",
