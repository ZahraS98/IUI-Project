The psychological abuse that they encourage players inflict upon each other is unheard of in any other video game i've ever played. The report system is fully automated with no judge or jury and allows gutless trolls and griefers to run amok. They encourage petty 'eye for an eye' behavior instead of good sportsmanship and bully players into staying in a match that has them being battered over and over. They allow griefers to flame the living daylights out of you then when you finally snap and stick up for yourself, those same flamers have you repremanded by said automatic report system and YOU end up being the one who is punished. And what's worse is that those griefers get thanked by Valve for causing harm to other players.But that's not all, people. No the abuse doesn't stop there. For a free to play game, this one will have you spending more money than its worth, dressing up your favorite heroes with expensive hats (some of which can only be won in Valve's treasure chest casino where they encourage children to gamble). Dota has gone from a fun strategy game to a cesspool of greed and mental torture since Valve published its sequel and took over. And now that they're filthy rich they don't even develop their own games anymore. They take the lions share of the profits gained from treasure chests and give the artists who created those skins a mere pittance for their work.

       "1892   Valve took a game that was wholesome and fun then turned it into a cash cow to be milked until it was dry as a dead husk. The psychological abuse that they encourage players inflict upon each other is unheard of in any other video game i've ever played. The report system is fully automated with no judge or jury and allows gutless trolls and griefers to run amok. They encourage petty 'eye for an eye' behavior instead of good sportsmanship and bully players into staying in a match that has them being battered over and over. They allow griefers to flame the living daylights out of you then when you finally snap and stick up for yourself, those same flamers have you repremanded by said automatic report system and YOU end up being the one who is punished. And what's worse is that those griefers get thanked by Valve for causing harm to other players.But that's not all, people. No the abuse doesn't stop there. For a free to play game, this one will have you spending more money than its worth, dressing up your favorite heroes with expensive hats (some of which can only be won in Valve's treasure chest casino where they encourage children to gamble). Dota has gone from a fun strategy game to a cesspool of greed and mental torture since Valve published its sequel and took over. And now that they're filthy rich they don't even develop their own games anymore. They take the lions share of the profits gained from treasure chests and give the artists who created those skins a mere pittance for their work. If you thought EA was bad, Valve just took the title from them for most soulless games company.   \n",

Fractured Space came off of early access recently and it reignited my love for space combat. Let's hit this off with segmented sections.Graphics: 9/10 Unreal Engine 4 has always looked good, but the amount of detail in the ship models is insane, the lighting, the beams, the rockets each ship has it's own distince style with each manufacturer having a different theme.Sound: 7/10 The Crew say interesting things and the sound is very good but there's nothing worth noting about it, it serves its job well enough to not be a nuisance.Gameplay: 8/10            Balance: It's definitely not pay-to-win, the ships are well balanced and there are no sure win strategies as this is also a game of deception, it's slow-paced and you will find yourselves dying by a decision you made 30 seconds ago. That means every warp in and warp out you decide cas consequences that can have an impact in the game, early deaths are less punishing and an early lead can easily be over taken with the right coordination and being at the right place at the right time.           Ships: Each ship design is vibrant and no two ships are alike with different roles even if both can do heals. Support craft and attack craft do have their counters but certain strategies can subvert that counter and the map often makes for interesting encounters that you won't feel unfair to either team.Payment Model: 8/10 Nothing is unfair and it's very much like LoL, I do feel the Crew could have more methods of acquisition, but overall it's not unfairTL;DR 8/10 Addictive, Fun and full of moments of wow. Please please if you are undecided, Try this game first before doling out judgement. I made this review because that's how much I love it.</td>\n",

And it works together just great. The game offers several gamemodes from standard ones like CTF and control points to some unique ones like Payload (a team has to push a cart from A to B)I've had so much fun with this game I couldn't even decribe it. It's amazing. This is the only game where you can hide as an invisible Spy under a box behind an enemy sniper while provoking him with shouting annoying things like that your knife will soon be in his back while he is trying hard to focus on aiming. This is the only game where you can start playing with a duck in a small pool in the middle of battlefield. This is the only game where you can high five with an enemy while your teammates are dying around.After 1300 hours I'm still not bored at all. Sure, it looks like a simple game for kids but TF2 is a unique team-based first person shooter full or irony, fun and sarcasm.

Turns out I was wrong! In order to change graphics settings, you just hop into a game press Esc and boom, change the graphics as your heart desires. Great responsive devs here to help even in the face of ignorance (me) and I'm grateful for the help. As for the game, it's fun, goofy, runs smoother than PUBG and with a WW2 theme backing it up, I'm sure any BR player can enjoy this. Can't wait for improvements!   \n",
       "1412   This will probably be my first ever review of any game and I have a lot of games that I've played. Fractured Space came off of early access recently and it reignited my love for space combat. Let's hit this off with segmented sections.Graphics: 9/10 Unreal Engine 4 has always looked good, but the amount of detail in the ship models is insane, the lighting, the beams, the rockets each ship has it's own distince style with each manufacturer having a different theme.Sound: 7/10 The Crew say interesting things and the sound is very good but there's nothing worth noting about it, it serves its job well enough to not be a nuisance.Gameplay: 8/10            Balance: It's definitely not pay-to-win, the ships are well balanced and there are no sure win strategies as this is also a game of deception, it's slow-paced and you will find yourselves dying by a decision you made 30 seconds ago. That means every warp in and warp out you decide cas consequences that can have an impact in the game, early deaths are less punishing and an early lead can easily be over taken with the right coordination and being at the right place at the right time.           Ships: Each ship design is vibrant and no two ships are alike with different roles even if both can do heals. Support craft and attack craft do have their counters but certain strategies can subvert that counter and the map often makes for interesting encounters that you won't feel unfair to either team.Payment Model: 8/10 Nothing is unfair and it's very much like LoL, I do feel the Crew could have more methods of acquisition, but overall it's not unfairTL;DR 8/10 Addictive, Fun and full of moments of wow. Please please if you are undecided, Try this game first before doling out judgement. I made this review because that's how much I love it.   \n",

Remember Tribes? Yeah, me neither.-Balance is a coin-toss. Buffed a broken god at one point calling him \"middle of the pack.\" Buffed Ullr to sell his super flashy (and expensive!) T5 skin. Meanwhile Bakasura sits at the bottom of the tierlist for YEARS.   \n",

The steering is terrible. My gamepad is set up fine but the cars are just terrible to control. Needs to be a little smoother to be enjoyable.   \n",

He died during stage 3 of his testicular cancer.  I got him this game, in hopes it would make him do better.  That maybe this game would give him a fighting chance.  My fathers last words were hard to bare. \"School of Dragons, was worse then stage 3 testicular cancer, and everynight I pray that I die, just so I won't have to live in a world in which this game exists.\"  My father died that night.   I rate this game 4/5 great graphics, beautiful storyline.  Terrible game, loved it.   \n",

They purposefully release new gods in a broken state to \"reward\" those who bought the gods access pass or those who saved to buy the new god. The company is all about a huge cash grab releasing skins in updates to try and distract from the fact that they ignore their community and refuse to balance anything. The game is really only fun if you pickup one of the generic, broken gods that can be played rather than any of the ones with a unique and fun kit because unique and fun just doesn't cut it here, you have to be generic and broken to win. Will never be able to recommend the game until they manage to fix the state it is in.   \n",

Let me say the game looks great animations are smooth and flowing and the art style is pretty good but sadly it suffers from many things. One is that it gets so repetitive its fun for an hour but then the enemys just stop being uniqe all you do is mash to win. Also there is no character creation i really wanted to see that is this game but it only has pre set characters character creation would have been a fantastic input.   \n",

Over 4000 hours played but Valve trying to make everyone conform to some weird standard. Your HUD should be able to be personalized. I have never had a problem with them making changes to heroes or the map but the HUD is only seen by the player and doesn't affect anyone else but the player. There should be a choice to reject the NEW HUD and play with the old version. I am sure that the old one can still function even with the new hero specific feature that was added.   \n",

But even so, I still manage to kill myself, so all in all I give it:11/10 would jump off the stage to my demise againI feel like this game can only get better from here on out unless they decide to implement some terrible pricing model. Judging from how the devs have handled things so far, I doubt that. One last thing to note is that the characters will have a rotation model a la DOTA, so you will have to unlock the characters you want.   \n",

And its for FREE99! I have played the the other NeverWinters. The Clasic Action RPG so vague you end up wandering in over powering lands. This game was made so you could go go go. It takes away from the openness a bit. But this gives you a fun start. Helps you to come back for more once it realy gets tuff.   \n",

       "3636                                   If I had to describe this game in a single word it would be FUN.Team Fortress 2 is a beautiful combination of sarcasm, weird humor, dynamic gameplay and comix-like graphics. And it works together just great. The game offers several gamemodes from standard ones like CTF and control points to some unique ones like Payload (a team has to push a cart from A to B)I've had so much fun with this game I couldn't even decribe it. It's amazing. This is the only game where you can hide as an invisible Spy under a box behind an enemy sniper while provoking him with shouting annoying things like that your knife will soon be in his back while he is trying hard to focus on aiming. This is the only game where you can start playing with a duck in a small pool in the middle of battlefield. This is the only game where you can high five with an enemy while your teammates are dying around.After 1300 hours I'm still not bored at all. Sure, it looks like a simple game for kids but TF2 is a unique team-based first person shooter full or irony, fun and sarcasm.

At first the game will likely feel a bit overwhelming with the enormous skill tree and endless options for builds and skills to use. My advice for first time players is to just play and make up a build as you go, don't overthink it at first.If you like Diablo 2 then you owe it to yourself to give this a try, it's free to play. The game is monetized by players paying for cosmetics and extra storage space for items beyond the generous space you get for free, no devious methods of separating players from their money as you see in so many other free to play games.   \n",
