It almost feels like a 50/50 split with my character missing almost every other attack. I may very well be missing some key quests or something and im just really under leveled and if thats so then ok... but iv been pretty thurough in my looking around zones so id hope thats not the case.

(Assassin class is my personal fav)Bots fill in empty spots on teams that are missing players, though they are NOT smart at all. You start shooting one and it will stop in place and only try to line up direct shots; making thier death that much easier. And the point difference between killing a player and a bot is marginal. You get around 40 more xp for killing a player.Graphics are wonderful. The deatail on the ships is well done. Turrets move with your cursor, thrusters fire off with movement (Small thrusters on different parts of the ship for turns), and damage to different hit locations are amazing. I.E. You take a bunch of damage to the engines, its starts to burn and spark. So far, no actual impedement of abililties/ movement from ship damage. Shading is well done. Its nice to be able to see an enemys' shadow on an asteroid before he cloaks, giving you at least an idea of where he is at.Sound is great. Voices are well done, for what they are in the current state of the game. Mostly little reminders of where enemies are attacking and such.Controls are ok. its nice to have different keys for up and down movement, but after playing any other space flight game it kind of seems a bit unneeded. just add mouse based movement (would be my best suggestion, with the add of cruise control that actually WORKS lmao). i dont know.. id be more used to it if i wasnt playing Star Conflict in the same day.Overall this game is a WIN. Do yourself a favor and buy this game and give out the free passes to your friends.heres to hoping they add parties/ groups :stein:</td>\n",

It almost feels like a 50/50 split with my character missing almost every other attack. I may very well be missing some key quests or something and im just really under leveled and if thats so then ok... but iv been pretty thurough in my looking around zones so id hope thats not the case. Id like to see this game improve. backed it on kickstarter but where it is right now is just a little bit upsetting   \n",
       "1557   Early Access ReviewI know i know... less than 3 hours played... clearly not enough time spent to fully appreciate this game.Oh, you just realized its EARLY ACCESS? moving right along...As of 3/4/15 this is what i think of the game:AwesomeOne map so far.A handful of ships to use, all different strengths, weaknesses, and skills. (Assassin class is my personal fav)Bots fill in empty spots on teams that are missing players, though they are NOT smart at all. You start shooting one and it will stop in place and only try to line up direct shots; making thier death that much easier. And the point difference between killing a player and a bot is marginal. You get around 40 more xp for killing a player.Graphics are wonderful. The deatail on the ships is well done. Turrets move with your cursor, thrusters fire off with movement (Small thrusters on different parts of the ship for turns), and damage to different hit locations are amazing. I.E. You take a bunch of damage to the engines, its starts to burn and spark. So far, no actual impedement of abililties/ movement from ship damage. Shading is well done. Its nice to be able to see an enemys' shadow on an asteroid before he cloaks, giving you at least an idea of where he is at.Sound is great. Voices are well done, for what they are in the current state of the game. Mostly little reminders of where enemies are attacking and such.Controls are ok. its nice to have different keys for up and down movement, but after playing any other space flight game it kind of seems a bit unneeded. just add mouse based movement (would be my best suggestion, with the add of cruise control that actually WORKS lmao). i dont know.. id be more used to it if i wasnt playing Star Conflict in the same day.Overall this game is a WIN. Do yourself a favor and buy this game and give out the free passes to your friends.heres to hoping they add parties/ groups :stein:   \n",

Very dissappointing.   \n",
