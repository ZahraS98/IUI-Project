# IUI-Project
Video Game recommender system

Questions:
Why was Alexa not recommended?
How functional does the product have to be? Is a functional code sufficient or do we need a prototype?
Do we need a report for the project? (e.g. why we chose a specific model etc.)
Do we need a Web-Interface or is terminal output sufficient?
